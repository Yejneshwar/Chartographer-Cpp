# ChartoGrapher C++ Client

Download the server from [ChartoGrapher Server](https://github.com/yejneshwar/Chartographer).

## Installation

##### Cmake

The library uses [GRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/) to communicate with the server.

Cmake will automatically dowload and setup `protoc` and `GRPC`.
